In [single page mode](https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted) the software will only appear under the first category in its `tags` list, so choose wisely.

### Add a tag/category

```yaml
# (required) project name
name: Project Management
 # (required) description of what this tag/category is about (markdown allowed)
description: '[Project management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_management) is the process of leading the work of a team to achieve all project goals within the given constraints.'
# (optional) list of related tags, by name
related_tags:
  - Ticketing
  - Task management & To-do lists
# (optional) external links
external_links:
  - title: awesome-sysadmin/Code Review
    url: https://github.com/awesome-foss/awesome-sysadmin#code-review
```

### Add a license

[Free and Open-Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) software licenses (preferably [SPDX identifier](https://spdx.org/licenses/), or custom licenses, must be added to `licenses.yml` (use [existing licenses](licenses.yml) as example):

```

### Add a language/platform

```yaml
# (required) language/platform name
name: Java
# (required) general description of the programming language or deployment platform
description: "[Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)) is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible."
```
