description: 'Web Servers and Reverse Proxies. A [web server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server) is a piece of software and underlying hardware that accepts requests via [HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol) (the network protocol created to distribute web content) or its secure variant [HTTPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS). A [Reverse Proxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_proxy) is a proxy server that appears to any client to be an ordinary web server, but in reality merely acts as an intermediary that forwards requests to one or more ordinary web servers.'
